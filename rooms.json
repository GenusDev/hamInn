These skills gave me insights into understanding and visualizing how markets shift and change in response to movements in demand, innovation, and planning. My academic track was public private development, which means I learned how to employ strategies and techniques that leverage private investment for infrastructure development and city building.",

It was as an economics major that I was first exposed to corporate finance and broad economic theory. I was also accepted into an interdisciplinary program for intrinsically motivated students called Community and Environmental Planning (CEP). Every aspect of CEP was devised for and by students. The open-dialogue format of our classes cultivated my ability to think critically and argue compassionately. We built strong connections with our professors, who supported us to take on ambitious projects and engage meaningfully with city and university institutions.",

I projected budgets, established KPIs, and drafted the terms of reference and work plans for 29 consultants.  I helped five cities implement data systems. I also worked closely with local planning officials to use what data was available to conduct analysis on urban expansion, land use/change, infrastructure accessibility, transit-oriented development, and slum upgrading strategies in order to guide infrastructure investments.",
