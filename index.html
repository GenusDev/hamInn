				    	<p>Our newly remodeled townhouse is a clean, welcoming, and spacious retreat. The house has 5 floors, 10 ft. ceilings with lots of natural light, 6 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, 2 kitchens, laundry room, and a private yard. In total, the house is 4,000+ square feet. The master bedroom is our largest room in the house. It has a shared bath and is furnished with a queen-size bed. It is the only room facing the street and thus has some noise, but it's not significant since you are 4 floors up.</p>

					<p>The room is small, and is separated by a wooden wall, that we have filled with plants, books and Xmas lights. The room has a closet, full length mirrors, and is next to a shared bathroom.  It is a bit of a DIY set up so it does not obscure sound completely from the hallway. That said, you only have to share the room with one other person and it is a nice hideaway in the house.</p>

					<p>This room is the nicest in the house in the sense that it is very spacious, has its own exit as well as a walk-in closet and an in-room bathroom. The private room includes three beds, one large queen and two twins, and yet still feels spacious. It is all included. Many couples book the room and use the extra beds as a couch. It is priced $10-$15 higher than our other rooms because it has a flexible cancellation policy, more amenities and because it can accommodate groups traveling together.</p>

					<p>It is a finished basement with a few beds in it. It isn't luxurious, but the space is well-maintained and clean. Because it stretches the length of the building, the room is large and very accommodating, but it is a basement and so it receives limited natural light. It's a flex space we use to sleep in when our rooms are booked. It is not a private space. </p>
					<p>The agreement for those who stay here is that they commit to around an hour of work around the house each day they stay, doing a requested task or routine upkeep sent the night before. We can adapt to the schedule of those who make the request to some degree, but we'd ideally like to have you around in the morning until at least 10AM to ideally 11/noon.</p>
					<p>For reference, the normal price of a bunk is around twice the cost, so this saves you 20 a night, which equates to making $20 an hour.</p>
					<p>The availability of this opportunity varies. We are looking for especially thoughtful and reliable people, who tend to stay for longer periods. We ask that if you inquiry about this room, you pitch yourself a bit in regards to what interests you, how seriously you will take your tasks, and what you are up to in Manhattan. Also please understand that we get a lot of interest given how cheap the room is, and if we can't accommodate your stay it is because someone can stay longer, or is more flexible with their time.</p>

					<h2>The House</h2>
					<p>We are a group of New Yorkers living in a big beautiful townhouse in Manhattan. We are excited to share our house with travelers to help us afford living here. We work in tech, in international/urban development, and theatre.</p>
					<p>It's a mixed neighborhood, with a large Puerto Rican population to the north, lots of students to the south and a large black population to the east. I'd like to think Hamilton Heights is the hippest part of upper Manhattan, but I might be biased. It is one of the safest neighborhoods in the city. There are cute bars and restaurants and a recent surge of gay people priced out of Hells Kitchen. If you are racist, homophobic, or xenophobic, you won't be comfortable here, or in most of NYC.  </p>

					<h2>House Rules</h2>
					<h4>Your Room/Guest Access</h4>
					<p>Put your shoes in the shoe pallet thing at the door, and make yourself at home! You have access to either kitchen (including the fridge), laundry in the basement, and private patio on the first floor, east side of the building. The large shampoo, conditioner, and mint soap is for you to use. We also provide laundry detergent for those who use the laundry. You will find a clean towel on your bed. Let us know if you need anything else. </p>
					<h4>Heat and AC</h4>
					<p>Please help us conserve energy by being mindful of closing doors and windows to help control the temperature within the place. Heating this large of a house is especially expensive. Help us keep the costs down for this place so we can keep it cheap for guests. Specifically, please keep all of the front doors closed. If it is too hot in your room, please turn down the thermostat and notify someone in the house. Please do not open a window.  </p>
					<h4>Internet</h4>
					<p>Network Name: Depot (There are multiple, all use the same password)
					<p>Password: NYSeattle<p>
					<p>If for any reason the Internet is not working, find the router in the window on the main kitchen floor and switch the power strip off and on once to reboot. Please do not watch or download copyrighted material with our internet.</p>
					<h4>Quiet Hours</h4>
					<p>
						<div>10pm-9am Sunday-Thursday</div>
						<div>12am-9am Friday-Saturday</div>
						<div>You’re in NYC! We are expecting you to be out late exploring the city. You can come and go as you please, but we ask that you be mindful of other guests as you do. Please, no laundry or going to the patio during these times.</div>
					</p>
					<h4>Garbage & Recycling</h4>
					<p>
						<div>Both kitchens have garbage cans. Recycling is set to the side of each can in paper bags. Make sure all recycled materials are rinsed and cleaned. Please don’t be the person who puts trash in the recycling bins.</div>
						<div>Mixed paper and cardboards can be grouped together in recycling (sits in left bag, when facing garbage can - look for labels). </div>
						<div>Glass, metal, and plastic containers can be grouped together in recycling (sits in right bag, when facing garbage can - look for labels). Do not put broken glass in recycling.</div>
						<div>Everything else goes in the garbage. Please sort your trash properly. Otherwise, we get fined.</div>
					</p>
					<h4>Mail</h4>
					<p>Mail packages at your own risk. If someone isn't home, sometimes packages are left outside the door, and we can’t guarantee they will be received on delivery. There is a USPS about 5 blocks away (146th St.), so if you can, have packages held there. There is a mail drop however at the house for letters.</p>
					<h4>Food</h4>
					<p>The blue dots on things mean they are common, like cheese, and granola that is made regularly. Even still, when you use common food, please put some change in the donation jar, and don’t expect it as sometimes our stock is low.  Though we frequently offer to share our food, breakfast is not listed as an amenity, and dropping a few coins in the donation bar will help us keep up with the expenses of the house. Please don’t eat other people’s food, and to be extra cautious I would suggest labeling your food. Please also clean whatever dishes that you use, preferably by hand. Avoid using the dishwasher unless you can completely fill it up. </p>
					<h4>Check-out</h4>
					<p>
						<div>Check-out is at 11am. Just leave your keys on the hook by the light switch next to the door, and your towels in your room. No need to touch base with us before you leave, unless you are leaving after 11. If you have a later flight out and want to leave your luggage at the house for the day, not a problem. We just need to clean the room and make sure the next guest has keys, so coordinate a check-out time that works. </div>
						<div>If you intend to extend, we will have you agree to various terms of conduct as well as a deposit reflecting a week’s payment, unless otherwise agreed. Staying beyond a 30 days does not provide tenants rights, as the guests agree that their stay is transitory in nature and understand that they have no further claim to stay beyond the days reserved via a payment.</div>

					<h2>FAQs</h2>

						<span>Q) Can we pay directly in cash?</span>
						<span>A) Please use AirBnB for all transactions. Once you are here and wish to stay longer term we may be able to negotiate something in person, but please confirm all initial transactions through AirBnB. They help us pay taxes, they provide our marketing, as well as a whole whose of services, but only if their fees are paid. </span>
					</p>

					<p>

						<span>A) The house does not have a garage or designated parking spot, but there is plenty of free street parking around the neighborhood, though expect to move your car regularly, unless you go into a parking garage.

					</p>

					<p>
						<span>Q) Where is the house located?</span>
						<span>A) The house is at the corner of 152nd and Broadway in Manhattan. AirBnb does not share the exact address until after you book.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span>Q) Is the neighborhood safe?</span>
						<span>A) Yes, the Hamilton Heights neighborhood is very safe. It ranks 33rd overall safest out of New York City’s 69 boroughs. (Chelsea & Hell’s Kitchen ranks 61, Downtown 63, Midtown 69). New York in general has seen crimes rate drop precipitously in the last 10 years.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span>Q) Can we check-in before/after 3pm?</span>
						<span>A) Before – We cannot promise you a room before check-in, but we will happily let you drop luggage off and relax in the common areas.</span>
						<span>After – Of course! We have a lock box setup for late arrivals, just let us know when you’ll be here.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span>Q) How does the deposit work?</span>
						<span>A) No security deposit is charged unless there are damages to the property. The amount specified just means that that is the most we can ask from you if you break things in the apartment. Nothing is deducted unless we request it. We have never had to request the deposit be used.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span>Q) Can I have guests over?</span>
						<span>A) Guests are welcome to visit anytime during the day. However, please let us know beforehand if you intend to have overnight guests. For safety reasons, we’d like a full name and will snap an image of their ID.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span>Q) Does the room have its own bathroom?</span>
						<span>A) Only half of our rooms have their own bathroom, but given that there are many bathrooms throughout the house, there is always one available. See listing for details on your room’s amenities.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span>Q) Can we send mail to the house?</span>
						<span>A) Mail at your own risk. We can’t guarantee they will be received on delivery. If no one is home, a slip will be left, and it will be held at the post office. The package may possibly be left outside if directions specify doing so. There is a USPS office about 5 blocks away (146th St.), so if you want to ensure you receive your parcels, you can have them held at the post office, and go there directly for pick up.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span>Q) Can I have a refund if I cancel last minute?</span>
						<span>A) Please don't request a full or partial refund if you have to cancel last minute, no matter how small. There is no exception to this rule. We don’t know if your grandma is actually dead or not, and the rent has to be paid regardless of if you missed your flight. It isn’t fair to reward the person who is the most angry and manipulative a refund when the policy is fairly clear upfront. The rooms are difficult to rebook last minute, and we don't want to have to feel like bad people by denying it. Please be familiar with the cancellation policy for the room you are booking. If you want a more flexible situation as your plans are not fixed, message us beforehand and we can figure something out, like put you in 1.2 or 1.1, which have more flexible refund policies, but do not message us the day before asking for a refund.</span>
