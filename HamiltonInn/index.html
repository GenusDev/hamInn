							<p>It is a finished basement with a few beds in it. It isn't luxurious, but the space is well-maintained and clean. Because it stretches the length of the building, the room is large and very accommodating, but it is a basement and so it receives limited natural light. It's a flex space we use to sleep in when our rooms are booked. It is not a private space. </p>
							<p>The agreement for those who stay here is that they commit to around an hour of work around the house each day they stay, doing a requested task or routine upkeep sent the night before. We can adapt to the schedule of those who make the request to some degree, but we'd ideally like to have you around in the morning until at least 10AM to ideally 11/noon.</p>
							<p>For reference, the normal price of a bunk is around twice the cost, so this saves you 20 a night, which equates to making $20 an hour.</p>
							<p>The availability of this opportunity varies. We are looking for especially thoughtful and reliable people, who tend to stay for longer periods. We ask that if you inquiry about this room, you pitch yourself a bit in regards to what interests you, how seriously you will take your tasks, and what you are up to in Manhattan. Also please understand that we get a lot of interest given how cheap the room is, and if we can't accommodate your stay it is because someone can stay longer, or is more flexible with their time.</p>
							<p><strong>Price:</strong> $20/night + 1 hour of work daily</p>

							<hr>
							<p>We are a group of New Yorkers living in a big beautiful townhouse in Manhattan. We are excited to share our house with travelers to help us afford living here. We work in tech, in international/urban development, and theatre.</p>
							<p>Our newly remodeled townhouse is a clean, welcoming, and spacious retreat for like-minded travelers who want a true New York City experience. The house has 5 floors, 10 ft. ceilings with lots of natural light, 6 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, 2 kitchens with top of the line appliances, laundry room, and a private yard. The house also has a big open co-working space on the third floor. In total, the house is over 4,000 square feet, which is quite large for Manhattan standards. Most of the house hosts private rooms, making it relatively clear and quiet.</p>
							<p>Hamilton Heights a mixed neighborhood, with a large latino population to the north, university students and faculty to the south and a historic black population to the east. The area is the 33rd safest for per capita crime out of 69 neighborhoods, according to <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/crime-safety-report/manhattan/west-harlem">DNAinfo.com's Crime & Safety Report</a>.  There are cute bars and restaurants and there has been a recent surge of gay people priced out of Hells Kitchen. If you are racist, homophobic, or xenophobic, you won't be comfortable here, or in most of NYC for that matter.</p>

							<h4>Check-in</h4>
							<p>We have a lockbox set up outside with keys to the house. See below for lock box details. We will ensure your room is ready by 3pm each day, though we may not always be present for your arrival, especially if you plan to arrive very late in the evening. During the day, feel free to ring the doorbell to see if someone is home, otherwise please use the lockbox. For an earlier check-in, please send us a message to coordinate. We cannot guarantee the room will be ready prior to 3pm, but we do allow guests to drop luggage off and relax in the common areas prior to check-in. </p>
							<h4>Lockbox</h4>
							<p>There are two doors to the house at the entrance. The black lockbox is attached to the black gate opposite the above door. Push the “c” button to be sure it is cleared. Then enter 2580*. People often forget the *.</p>
							<p>Push the topmost button with a down arrow and the box should open. Use one of the keys with a green tag to let yourself in the two main doors with glass fronts at the TOP of the front steps. The second door can get stuck, but we promise the key works for both doors!</p>
							<p>Once you’ve unlocked the two doors, please RETURN the key to the lockbox and be sure to CLOSE it! To close the lockbox, re-enter 2580* and push the topmost button with a down arrow to lock it.  This key is for arrivals only. You will find your keys in your room hanging on a hook.</p>
							<p>You will find a map on the inner door, which shows you where your room is. Pay attention to the number at the end of the title of your booking for reference.</p>
							<p>If you have any issues, give us a call and we can walk you through it, or potentially have someone from the house to let you in.</p>
							<h4>Your Room/Guest Access</h4>
							<p>Put your shoes in the shoe pallet thing at the door, and make yourself at home! You have access to either kitchen (including the fridge), laundry in the basement, and private patio on the first floor, east side of the building. The large shampoo, conditioner, and mint soap is for you to use. We also provide laundry detergent for those who use the laundry. You will find a clean towel on your bed. Let us know if you need anything else. </p>
							<h4>Heat and AC</h4>
							<p>Please help us conserve energy by being mindful of closing doors and windows to help control the temperature within the place. Heating this large of a house is especially expensive. Help us keep the costs down for this place so we can keep it cheap for guests. Specifically, please keep all of the front doors closed. If it is too hot in your room, please turn down the thermostat and notify someone in the house. Please do not open a window.  </p>
							<h4>Internet</h4>
							<p>Network Name: Depot (There are multiple, all use the same password)
							<p>Password: NYSeattle<p>
							<p>If for any reason the Internet is not working, find the router in the window on the main kitchen floor and switch the power strip off and on once to reboot. Please do not watch or download copyrighted material with our internet.</p>
							<h4>Quiet Hours</h4>
							<p>
								<div>11:30pm - 9am Sunday - Thursday</div>
								<div>1am - 9am Friday - Saturday</div>
								<div>You’re in NYC! We are expecting you to be out late exploring the city. You can come and go as you please, but we ask that you be mindful of other guests as you do. Please, no laundry or going to the patio during these times.</div>
							</p>
							<h4>Garbage & Recycling</h4>
							<p>
								<div>Both kitchens have garbage cans. Recycling is set to the side of each can. Make sure all recycled materials are rinsed and cleaned. Please don’t be the person who puts trash in the recycling bins. Plastic bags are not recyclable as of now in NYC. </div>
								<div>Mixed paper and cardboards can be grouped together in recycling (sits in left bag, when facing garbage can - look for labels). Glass, metal, and plastic containers can be grouped together in recycling (sits in right bag, when facing garbage can - look for labels). Do not put broken glass in recycling.</div>
								<div>Everything else goes in the garbage. Aluminum or Styrofoam are not recyclable. Please sort your trash properly. Otherwise, we get fined.</div>
							</p>
							<h4>Food</h4>
							<p>We offer homemade, all natural granola to all of our guests. When you use common food, we’d if you’d put some change in the donation jar, and don’t expect it as sometimes our stock is low though we do make it regularly. Though we frequently offer to share our food, breakfast is not listed as an amenity, and dropping a few coins in the donation bar will help us keep up with the expenses of the house. Please don’t eat other people’s food, and, to be extra cautious, I would suggest labeling your food though we have never had any problems with people’s food being eaten . Please also clean whatever dishes that you use, preferably by hand. Avoid using the dishwasher unless you can completely fill it up.</p>
							<h4>Laundry</h4>
							<p>We are willing to do your laundry for you. We ask that you notify us that you need laundry done, and that you place your laundry outside your door in a bag. We ask that for each load you chip in $3. It would be around $8 to do so at the laundry across the street.</p>
							<h4>Mail</h4>
							<p>Mail packages at your own risk. If someone isn't home, sometimes packages are left outside the door, and we can’t guarantee they will be received on delivery. There is a USPS about 5 blocks away (146th St.), so if you are concerned about receiving a package, have packages held there. There is a mail drop at the house for letters.</p>
							<h4>Check-out</h4>
							<p>
								<div>Check-out is at 11am. Just leave your keys on the hook by the light switch next to the door, <strong>and please keep your towels in your room</strong>. No need to touch base with us before you leave, unless you are leaving after 11AM. If you have a later flight out and want to leave your luggage at the house for the day, not a problem. We just need to clean the room and make sure the next guest has keys, so coordinate a check-out time that works. If you want to store luggage for multiple days, it is $40 a day for 3 or more bags, and only $20 for one suitcase.</div>
								<div>If you intend to extend, we will have you agree to various terms of conduct as well as a deposit reflecting a week’s payment, unless otherwise agreed. Staying beyond a 30 days does not provide tenants rights, as the guests agree that their stay is transitory in nature and understand that they have no further claim to stay beyond the days reserved via a payment.</div>

							<h4>Transit</h4>
							<p>The house is conveniently on Broadway, just north of 152nd. We are steps away from the red and blue subway lines. Catch the 1 train (red line) at 157th and Broadway. The A & C trains (blue line) are on the 155th and St. Nicholas local station.</p>
							<h4>Parking</h4>
							<p>Stable Car Parking Lot is on 153rd, one street north of the house. Rates start at $22/day and $300/month</p>
							<h4>Biking</h4>
							<p>We are trying to get extra bikes to rent for $20 a day, so ask if we have them. Biking is a very nice way to get around in Manhattan, especially for exploring Central Park.</p>

							<h4>Restaurants</h4>
							<p>
								<div>Chopped Parsley: Best neighborhood spot for Asian fusion, especially sushi.</div>

								<div>Bono Trattoria: Fine Italian joint with a rustic ambiance and great cocktails.</div>
							</p>
							<h4>Bars</h4>
							<p>
								<div>Harlem Public – This is the neighborhood hotspot. Great spot to grab gourmet burgers and micro-brews.</div>
								<div>Anchor Wine Bar – Great brunch spot, and of course, great wine selection.</div>
							</p>
							<h4>Cafés</h4>
							<p>
								<div>Chipped Cup – Quaint café that’s easy to overlook, but you don’t want to miss their outdoor patio!</div>
								<div>Taszo Espresso Bar – A great spot to grab a bite to eat in the morning and have kombucha on tap.</div>
								<div>Hamilton’s Bakery – It’s a more spacious cafe than the Chipped Cup - Try their pizza special in the pm.</div>
							</p>
							<h4>Runners & Cyclists</h4>
							<p>We live right next to the Hudson River, just one block away from Riverside Drive. You’re next to the most beautiful trail that expands all of Manhattan alongside the Hudson. We highly recommend checking out the trail while you’re here. We are trying to get extra bikes to rent for $20 a day, so ask if we have them. Biking is a very nice way to get around in Manhattan, especially for exploring Central Park.</p>

							<h4 class="modal-title">FAQs</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="modal-body">
							<p>
								<span>Q) Are these dates available?</span>
								<span>A) Our AirBnb calendar is always up to date. If you are able to request it, it’s yours. Our guests often rebook or extend their stay, so we recommend booking while you can. Inquiries do not reserve the room.</span>
							</p>

							<p>
								<span>Q) Can we pay directly in cash?</span>
								<span>A) Please use AirBnB for all transactions. Once you are here and wish to stay longer term we may be able to negotiate something in person, but please confirm all initial transactions through AirBnB. They help us pay taxes, they provide our marketing, as well as a whole whose of services, but only if their fees are paid. </span>
							</p>

							<p>
								<span>Q) Where should we park?</span>
								<span>A) The house does not have a garage or designated parking spot, but there is plenty of free street parking around the neighborhood, though expect to move your car regularly, unless you go into a parking garage. Stable Car Parking Lot is one block north of the house on 153rd, between Broadway and Riverside Dr. Rates start at $22 per 24hr and $300 per month.</span>
							</p>

							<p>
								<span>Q) How far are you from ______ via public transportation?</span>
								<span>A)</span>
								<span>1) JFK - ~90 minutes (42 mins by taxi) (Best train route depends on the time of day, but E to the C/A is common)</span>
								<span>2) LGA - ~60 minutes (35 mins by taxi)</span>
								<span>3) Newark Liberty International Airport</span>
								<span>4) Times Square - ~30 Minutes</span>
								<span>5) Anywhere else in the city – Check out the <a href="http://tripplanner.mta.info/MyTrip/ui_web/customplanner/TripPlanner.aspx">MTA Trip Planner website.</a></span>
							</p>

							<p>
								<span>Q) Where is the house located?</span>
								<span>A) The house is at the corner of 152nd and Broadway in Manhattan. AirBnb does not share the exact address until after you book.</span>
							</p>

							<p>
								<span>Q) Is the neighborhood safe?</span>
								<span>A) Yes, the Hamilton Heights neighborhood is very safe. It ranks 33rd overall safest out of New York City’s 69 boroughs. (Chelsea & Hell’s Kitchen ranks 61, Downtown 63, Midtown 69). New York in general has seen crimes rate drop precipitously in the last 10 years.</span>
							</p>

							<p>
								<span>Q) Can we check-in before/after 3pm?</span>
								<span>A) Before – We cannot promise you a room before check-in, but we will happily let you drop luggage off and relax in the common areas.</span>
								<span>After – Of course! We have a lock box setup for late arrivals, just let us know when you’ll be here.</span>
							</p>

							<p>
								<span>Q) How does the deposit work?</span>
								<span>A) No security deposit is charged unless there are damages to the property. The amount specified just means that that is the most we can ask from you if you break things in the apartment. Nothing is deducted unless we request it. We have never had to request the deposit be used.</span>
							</p>

							<p>
								<span>Q) Can I have guests over?</span>
								<span>A) Guests are welcome to visit anytime during the day. However, please let us know beforehand if you intend to have overnight guests. For safety reasons, we’d like a full name and will snap an image of their ID.</span>
							</p>

							<p>
								<span>Q) Does the room have its own bathroom?</span>
								<span>A) Only half of our rooms have their own bathroom, but given that there are many bathrooms throughout the house, there is always one available. See listing for details on your room’s amenities.</span>
							</p>

							<p>
								<span>Q) Can we send mail to the house?</span>
								<span>A) Mail at your own risk. We can’t guarantee they will be received on delivery. If no one is home, a slip will be left, and it will be held at the post office. The package may possibly be left outside if directions specify doing so. There is a USPS office about 5 blocks away (146th St.), so if you want to ensure you receive your parcels, you can have them held at the post office, and go there directly for pick up.</span>
							</p>

							<p>
								<span>Q) Can I have a refund if I cancel last minute?</span>
								<span>A) Please don't request a full or partial refund if you have to cancel last minute, no matter how small. There is no exception to this rule. The rent has to be paid regardless if you missed your flight. It isn’t fair to reward the person who is the most angry and manipulative a refund when the policy is fairly clear upfront. The rooms are difficult to rebook last minute, and we don't want to have to feel like bad people by denying it. Please be familiar with the cancellation policy for the room you are booking. If you want a more flexible situation as your plans are not fixed, message us beforehand and we can figure something out, like put you in 1.2 or 1.1, which have more flexible refund policies, but do not message us the day before asking for a refund.</span>
